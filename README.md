# salt-laptop
basic salt repo for bootstrapping a laptop with some of the basic configurations I use

Though it's very specific to my usecase, I'm also keeping in mind that my home network could
benefit from this configuration as well, so I've tried to keep hard coding of names to a minimum.

It currently is also indifferent about roles and hardware configurations, which I may or may not
change in the future.


Found this authors guidelines, and it gave me an idea to finalize my own set of guidelines / principals
# Authors Guidelines
* if it is not in the docs it does not exist
* if it is not tested it is broken
* done is better than perfect
* keep it stupid simple
