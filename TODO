TODO:
in users.init add a new state ( users.pull_dotfiles )
and use the dotfiles in there for bashrc, aliases, functions, etc ... or just pull them all from dot files into here... actually, that might be the better way to keep them all in once place... but also makes it more tightly coupled to salt, and less indendent... so keep it in dotfiles, and pull it into salt via git and link files

Done-ish:
* dotfiles
* SSH Keys
* script to backup all private keys
* slack
* snaps
* global git config files
* zoom
